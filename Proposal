# Title
Five-Year Spotify Analysis project

## Executive Summary

The Five-Year Spotify Analysis will take a look at top songs from top Billboard albums within the five year range beginning at the year 2017 through 2021. These songs will be used in order to analyze any comparisons or contrasts they may hold. The purpose of this project is to reveal whether there are any changes to valence in the music as the years have passed. In analyzing this, questions about whether the sound of music is positive and cheerful or negative and depressive can be answered. 
In efforts to expose valence throughout the years a spotify playlist will be created and this data will be pulled and be analysed and visualized. This playlist will be used to possibly meausure genre, tempo, and explicit lyrics. In analyzing this data it will be possible to predict what next years top genre might or might not be.


## Project Objectives

This project is a passion project for Katie and Bianca. With music being a vital part in their everyday lives it was decided that analyzing music data would inspire quests. An onset of this quest was the expanded question of whether the pandemic altered the valence in music. The main goal of this project is to analyze valence in music within the range of the last five years. These analyzations will measure the valence by scores and there are other variables that will impact this project. Some other important factors that will be measured and analyzed will be, expicit lyrics, tempo, and genre.


## Background

This data set used for this project has been created by Katie. A spotify playlist has been created with all the songs that will be used for all the analyses. This dataset will be a good representation of top songs for the years 2017 through 2021. 

## Scope

There will be a variety of softwares used to perform the analyses in this project. Python will be used for the coding and data pulling, R will be used to run the analyses and charting, Tableau will be used for visualizations and charting as well, and lastly Github for version control and project managing using it's Kanban board. 

## Functional requirements

*This is where most of the detail should reside.  describe all of the required capabilities of the system in detail.  It is helpful to articulate features in terms of user capabilities.  Keep in mind that the features will be designed and developed off of these descriptions, so if you leave anything up to interpretation, you run the risk of the results not meeting your expectations.  You can also assume capabilities that are not mentioned here will not be included in the project, no matter how common or obvious they are.  You may want to break our subsections for each major feature to make the document more organized.*


## Personnel requirements

*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

## Delivery schedule

*It's often helpful to break a project out into phases or milestones.  In this section list out any logical checkpoints where you would like to see the project demonstrated to ensure that expectations are being met.  Describe the phase, and the functional requirements required for completion.*

## Other requirements

*This section serves as a catch-all for any details that may not fit in other areas.  things like device or browser support, considerations for accessibility or inspiration for style.  Offer additional context here to ensure the project meets your vision*

## Assumptions

*Oftentimes we are reliant on outside sources such as frameworks to be used, or services that our system will depend on.  In this section you should provide detail on any assumptions that you have made, such as the system being reliant on the availability of the Google Maps API.*

## Limitations

*Identify any limitations in terms of time, personnel, technical details, or other things that limit the scope, time, and cost of the project being discussed.*

## Risks

*Every project has inherent risks that may cause delay or even failure of a project.  You must identify this risks to show you know what they are, and also identify ways in which you would mitigate those risks.*
