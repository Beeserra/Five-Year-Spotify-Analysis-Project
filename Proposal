# Title

Five-Year Spotify Analysis project


## Executive Summary

The Five-Year Spotify Analysis will take a look at songs from top Billboard albums within the five year range from 2017 through 2021. These songs will be used in order to analyze correlations and trends between yearly charts and within different groups of tracks. Analysis will be performed to determine whether there are any overall changes in valence, the measurement of predicted song "mood", of the top albums' most popular tracks from year to year. Analyses to determine whether there are changes in the frequency and popularity of tracks with explicit lyrics.

In order to collect data, a Spotify playlist for the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart for each year will be created and this data will be pulled and be analyzed and visualized. This dataset will be used to possibly measure genre, tempo, and energy. 


## Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to analyze the audio features of included playlist tracks within the range of the last five years. These analyses will compare valence as well as frequency of explicit lyrics, tempo variance, and genre correlation.


## Background

This project is a passion project for Katie and Bianca. With music being a vital part in their everyday lives it was decided that analyzing music data would inspire quests. An onset of this quest was the expanded question of whether the pandemic altered the valence in music. This data set used for this project has been created by Katie. A Spotify playlist has been created with all the songs that will be used for all the analyses. This dataset will present a representation of top songs for the years 2017 through 2021. 


## Scope

The scope of this project will extend to analysis of tracks from the Top 200 Album charts for the past five years. Analysis will neither extend further back beyond that time scope or project forward more than a year beyond the current chart year. Analyses will include only features readily available and accessible through Spotify's public API and standard documentation. 



## Functional requirements

Data set: The data is composed of tracks from albums that have been placed in chart-year based playlists on Spotify. Each Spotify playlist is then pulled into Python and used to compile a larger dataset of songs contained on each full album listed not he yearly charts.

Data Wrangling: The dataset will then be cleaned up and unnecessary columns will be removed. The data will then be subsetted to produce a more concise and manageable dataset.  Each column will be converted to the appropriate datatype in order to successfully execute analysis. The main columns that will remain in the data set are Artist Name, Album Name, Genre, Duration, Tempo, Valence, Explicit, and Popularity.

Data Analysis: Data will be analyzed primarily in R with preliminary visualizations.

Data Visualization: Data visualizations will primarily be finalized in Tableau. Planned visualizations of valence, tempo, and genre will also be tabled and graphed in comparison and contrasts of each other. 

Presentation: Findings will be presented via Zoom/Webex.


## Personnel requirements

Katie and Bianca are Data Science students. They will work closely and touch base daily to work for check in and project updates. These daily meetings will involve analyzing and problem solving. Daily communications will be through text message, slack, and zoom. 


## Delivery schedule

Week 1: Create and complete data set that will be used. Once dataset is created and pulled, import to R for analysis. Keep Github updated.

Week 2: Compile questions that are interesting from dataset and begin analyzing dataset.


## Other requirements

All softwares and programs used are free and accessible by Katie and Bianca. 


## Assumptions

It can be assumed that the software and programs being used for this project are all accessible with ease. They are accessed through computers, tablets, and smart phones. 


## Limitations

The limitations possible are of schedule conflicts and between Katie and Bianca and with the instructors. It is possible that one might need to shift work time to earlier or later in the day and that can push back the timeline. 

## Risks

Music is a broad topic and this can come with many risks such as being overwhelmed with questions and not having a finite answer to some of the questions. A risk of this project is running into a road block with the dataset used because the data set was created and pulled for this project specifically. There is possibility that the dataset might not measure. Another risk may be the dataset being too small.
